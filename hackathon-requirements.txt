What to Build
Your mission is to use the provided race Datasets to develop a project that provides novel insights or tools. Your project can be anything from a software application, to a predictive model, or an in-depth analytical report, or even an interactive dashboard or anything else you can think of.

Choose one of the following categories to compete in:

1) Driver Training & Insights: Create a tool or analysis that could help a driver identify areas for improvement, optimize their racing line, or better understand their performance.
2) Pre-Event Prediction: Can you predict the future? Develop a model to forecast qualifying results, race pace, tire degradation, or other key performance indicators before the green flag drops.
3) Post-Event Analysis: Go beyond the final standings. Create a dashboard or report that tells the story of the race, revealing key moments and strategic decisions that led to the outcome.
4) Real-Time Analytics: Design a tool that simulates real-time decision-making for a race engineer. What's the perfect pit stop window? How can you react to a caution flag?
5) Wildcard: Have a brilliant idea that doesn’t fit the categories above? Surprise us! This category is for the most creative and out-of-the-box applications of racing data.
We’re looking to develop a real-time analytics and strategy tool for the GR Cup Series that will help enhance driver insights, team performance, and race-day decision-making.
